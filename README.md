3D Driving Simulator


Overview
The 3D Driving Simulator is a Unity-based application designed to provide a realistic and immersive driving experience. This simulator replicates various driving scenarios with detailed environments, accurate vehicle dynamics, and customizable settings. It serves as a tool for driver training, traffic research, and autonomous vehicle testing.

Features
Realistic Vehicle Physics: Simulates acceleration, braking, steering, and collision dynamics.
Immersive 3D Environments: Includes urban, rural, and highway scenarios with detailed graphics.
Customizable Scenarios: Configure weather conditions, traffic density, and road layouts.
Traffic AI: Simulates traffic flow and interactions with dynamic AI-controlled vehicles.
Modular Design: Easily extendable to include new terrains, vehicles, or features.
Multi-Platform Support: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and VR devices (if integrated).
